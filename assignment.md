# Assignment AE.1.4: Interview Practice App

## Overview
Interview preparation application built with Next.js and OpenAI API. Generates customized interview questions based on job role, type, and difficulty level.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Research & Interview Preparation Focus
- Technical interviews for software engineering positions
- Behavioral questions for leadership and teamwork assessment
- Role-specific questions for different job types
- Structured mock interview format

### 2. Frontend Implementation
- Next.js 14 with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Component-based architecture

### 3. OpenAI API Integration
- GPT-4 model integration
- Secure API key management
- Error handling and retry logic
- Response parsing and validation

### 4. System Prompts with Different Techniques

**Few-Shot Learning**
```
You are conducting a technical interview. Here are example questions:
Q: "Explain the difference between REST and GraphQL"
Q: "How would you optimize a slow database query?"
Generate 3 similar questions for a Senior Developer role.
```

**Chain-of-Thought**
```
Think through this step by step:
1. Consider the job requirements for {role}
2. Assess the {difficulty} level requested
3. Focus on {interviewType} skills
4. Generate appropriate questions
```

**Zero-Shot**
```
Generate interview questions for {role} position at {difficulty} level.
Focus on {interviewType} competencies.
```

**Role-Based**
```
You are a {role} interviewer with 10+ years experience.
Your style is professional and thorough.
Create interview questions that reflect industry standards.
```

**Structured Output**
```
Format each question as:
Question: [actual question]
Skills Tested: [specific competencies]
Expected Answer Length: [brief/detailed]
```

### 5. OpenAI Parameter Tuning
- **Temperature**: 0.7 for balanced creativity and consistency
- **Max Tokens**: 1000 for comprehensive responses
- **Top-p**: 0.9 for quality control
- **Frequency Penalty**: 0.3 to reduce repetition

### 6. Security Measures
- Input sanitization to prevent prompt injection
- Rate limiting on API calls
- Job role validation against predefined list
- Error message sanitization
- Environment variable protection

## Optional Tasks Completed

**Easy Level**
- Multiple difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- Domain-specific interview types
- Enhanced input validation

**Medium Level**
- Admin panel for advanced analysis
- GitHub repository analysis feature
- User-configurable OpenAI parameters

**Advanced Features**
- TypeScript for type safety
- Professional UI/UX design
- Real-time question generation
- Comprehensive error handling

## Technical Architecture

**Frontend**
- Next.js App Router
- React components with hooks
- Tailwind CSS utility classes
- TypeScript interfaces

**Backend**
- Next.js API routes
- OpenAI API client
