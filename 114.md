**Description:**

In this project, you will need to build an Interview Practice app with prompt engineering, an OpenAI API, and a user interface.

Later, you could use this for your own needs to practice for interviews. 

**Topics:**

* Interview Prep 
* ChatGPT
* Prompt Engineering
* Web applications

**Prerequisites:**

* Python or JavaScript knowledge 
* Knowledge of ChatGPT and OpenAI API
* Basic knowledge of building a front-end application

**Estimated time to complete:** 5 hours

## Task Description

A huge round of applause comes to you for reaching this step. You have started with sprint 1 on prompt-engineering. You are just at the start of the AI engineering course, but you know the very basics, so let's get that into action.

This project will be a good starter. You will build your own Interview Preparation app. I would imagine that you have participated in several interviews at some point. You have been asked questions. You were given exercises or some personality tests to complete.

Imagine if there is a way to practice for all of that in an efficient and interesting way.

Fortunately, ChatGPT comes to help. With it, you can do pretty much everything, including preparing for your next dream position.

Your task will be to implement a single-page website using **VS Code** (or Cursor) editor, and either a Python library called Streamlit or a JavaScript framework called Next.js.

You would need to call OpenAI, write a system prompt as the instructions for ChatGPT, and your own prompt with the interview prep instructions.

You will have a lot of freedom in the things you want to practice for your interview. We don't want you to put it in the box. Interview Questions? Specific programming language questions? Asking questions at the end of the interview? Analyzing the job description to come up with the interview preparation strategy? Experiment!

**If you feel confident and have experience in software engineering, feel free to over-engineer the app by adding different things from the Optional Tasks, plus coming up with your own things. You can try making it as a portfolio project!**

Remember, you have all of your tools at your disposal if, for some reason, you get stuck or need inspiration: ChatGPT, StackOverflow, or your friend!

## Task Requirements

**The exact task requirements are as follows:**

1. Research the exact nature of interview preparation you want to do. This is intended as we want you to explore and get creative!
2. Figure out how you are going to build the front-end, either using [specific Streamlit components](https://streamlit.io/components?category=text), or HTML/CSS in Next.js.
3. Create an OpenAI API Key for this project.
4. Write at least 5 system prompts with different techniques (few-shot learning, Chain-of-Thought, Zero-Shot Prompting, etc) and check which one works best for you.
5. Tune at least one OpenAI setting (temperature, Top-p, frequency, etc).
6. Add at least one security guard to your app to prevent misuse.

## Optional Tasks

After the main functionality is implemented and your code works correctly, and you feel that you want to upgrade your project, choose one or more improvements from this list.
The list is sorted by difficulty levels. 

**Caution: Some of the tasks in medium or hard categories may contain tasks with concepts or libraries that may be introduced in later sections or even require outside knowledge/time to research outside of the course.**

**Easy:**
1. Ask ChatGPT to critique your solution from the usability, security, and prompt-engineering sides.
2. Improve ChatGPT prompts for your personal domain in which you would like to interview prep: IT, finance, HR, communication, etc.
3. Implement more security constraints, like user input validation and system prompt validation. Could we consider utilizing ChatGPT to verify these aspects?
4. Simulate different difficulty levels – Adjust the complexity of interview questions (easy, medium, hard).
5. Optimize prompts for concise vs. detailed responses – Experiment with prompting ChatGPT to give short or in-depth answers.
6. Generate interviewer guidelines – Ask ChatGPT to create structured evaluation criteria for technical and behavioral interviews.
7. Simulate a mock interview with AI personas – Ask ChatGPT to role-play as a strict, neutral, or friendly interviewer.

**Medium:**
1. Add all of the OpenAI settings (models, temperature, frequency, etc.) for the user to tune as sliders/fields.
2. Implement at least two structured JSON output formats for the interview preparation.
3. Deploy your app to the Internet. 
4. Calculate and provide output to the user on the price of the prompt.
5. Read [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview) documentation, think of your own improvement, and implement it.
6. Use Gemini, Claude or a different LLM to act as LLM 2 that would validate the output of the main LLM 1 that is used to generate interview preparation (LLM as a judge).
7. Try to jailbreak (break into) your own application by trying to provide an invalid prompt, message, job file, etc. Provide the results of this experiment in an Excel sheet.
8. Add a separate text field or another field to include the job description (the position) you are applying for and getting interview preparation for that particular position (RAG).
9. Provide the user with the ability to choose from a list of LLMs (Gemini, OpenAI, etc.) for this project.
10. Think of a creative way; how could you use image generation inside this project and implement it using code?

**Hard:**
1. Using Streamlit (Python) or React (JS) components, implement a full-fledged chatbot application instead of a one-time call to the OpenAI API.
2. Deploy your app to one of these cloud providers: Gemini, AWS, or Azure.
3. Use LangChain packages to implement the app using chains or agents.
4. Add a vector database to check if the provided interview preparation data was seen before, prompting LLM to generate new interview preparation data.
5. Use open-source LLMs (not Gemini, OpenAI, etc.) for the project.
6. [Fine-tune](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning) an LLM to have an interview preparation focus.

## Evaluation Criteria

**Understanding Core Concepts:**
* The learner can explain different types of prompting techniques clearly.
* The learner understands how different LLM settings (temperature, top-p, etc.) work and how they affect the output.
* The learner understands the differences between user, system, and assistant roles.
* The learner demonstrates understanding of different LLM output types.

**Technical Implementation:**
* The learner's project works as intended; you can prepare for an interview by asking for help from the ChatGPT.
* The learner's project successfully calls the OpenAI API with the correct parameters.
* The learner successfully used a front-end library to build the UI of the project.

 **Reflection and Improvement:**
* The learner can explain their choice of the prompt engineering techniques and parameter settings.
* The learner understands the potential problems with the application
* The learner can offer suggestions on improving the code and the project

**Bonus Points:**
* For maximum points, the learner should implement **at least 2 medium and hard optional tasks**.

**If you want to push yourself even higher, implement all of the optional tasks!**

## How to get started with Streamlit

It is very likely that you are seeing and hearing about Streamlit for the first time. No worries!

It's a fantastic framework for creating interactive web apps using Python, particularly for **data visualization**, **machine learning demos**, and **quick prototyping**.

You don't need to know much about front-end things, like HTML, CSS, JS, React, or others, to build apps! Streamlit will do the basics of front-end for you by just writing Python code.

**Learning Streamlit:**

* You can get started by watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0D4Pa22iG0&ab_channel=pixegami). 
* After that, check out their [page](https://streamlit.io/). 
* Check their documentation on [page elements](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference). 
* A good starting point could be their ["Get Started" section](https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started).
* Lastly, GeeksForGeeks also offers a good tutorial on [Streamlit](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-beginners-guide-to-streamlit/).

## Approach to solving the task

* Take a look at the "How to Get Started" section (added below) to get some ideas on how to get started with building a web page.
* 1-5 hours of attempting to solve the task using your own knowledge + ChatGPT. It is encouraged to use ChatGPT both for:
    * Understanding this task better
    * Writing the code
    * Improving the code
    * Understanding the code
* If you feel that some knowledge is missing, please revisit the parts in Sprint 1 OR check out additional resources.
* If during the first 1-2 hours you see you are making no progress and that the task seems much too hard for you, we recommend 10 more hours working on the problem with help from peers and JTLs. 
* Out of these 10 hours, you are expected to spend about half of them working with someone else—whether it is peer study buddies, peers who have completed the exercise and want to help you, or JTLs in open sessions.
* If you still can't solve it, check the suggested solution and spend as much time as needed (also based on what you have available until the next deadline) to understand it.
